  <b>My NYSC journey started at <i>Agwu Camp</i> <br>in Enugu in February, 2014.<br>The 3-weeks Boot Camp was really <br> a training ground with the various<br> parade by different Cadet groups.<br>The camp Commanders leaves no stone unturned<br>in ensuring that we were drilled to <br>the core early in the morning (by 5a.m)<br> under the rain and in the sunshine.

  <p>
     <b>We participated in other activities like              <ul>
          <li>mountain climbing</li> 
          <li>climbing of ropes</li> 
          <li>slipping through types</li>
          <li>falling like a mango tree</li> 
</ul>

  <b>The Camp exposed me to people from diverse cultures <br>and tribal nationalities. I met other graduates <br><i>from all walks of life</i> from diverse <br>tribes, cultures and background. Also, I learnt<br>to cook delicacies from other tribes and made some new friends. Their names:
